    text: "\nThis template is a good starting point for people who want to develop Reflect Custom Viewers.
\n\nThis project includes :
\n- the Reflect package,
\n- a sample scene with a sample Reflect prefab ready to be customized,
\n- a sample script to show the Project Metadatas by groups/keys/value,
\n- a sample Post Processing asset to be tweaked,
\n- and Image Import Rules for UI items.
\n\nAll you need to jump-start development!
\n\nThe SunStudy Canvas is overriden with InputFields and a custom script to make the Lat&Long values editable.
\nSimply revert the SunStudy Canvas prefab, from within the Reflect Viewer prefab, to restore it to its original state.
\n\nThe sample View Info panel and script, as well as the custom SplashScreen disabling, are added as 'overrides' on the Prefab.
\nTo start from a fresh UI, simply 'Revert' the Prefab."
